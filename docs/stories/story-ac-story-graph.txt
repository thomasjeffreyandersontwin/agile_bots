                        WHEN Strory Graph Node ceates new child Node
                        THEN parent Story Node creates new child node of of appropriate  type with provided name
                        AND parent Story Node adds the child as the last child of its children
                        Example: child = bot.story_graph.epics["epic name"].createChild("child name")
                        
                        WHEN Story Graph Node creates new child with position specified
                        THEN parent Story Node adds the child as the specfied position
                        AND resequences all children at or after the position
                        Example: child = bot.story_graph.epics["epic name"].createChild("child name", 2)

                        WHEN Story Graph Node creates  new child with invalid position specified
                        THEN adjusts position to last if exceeds children count
                        AND creates new child node with provided data at adjusted position
                        Example: child = bot.story_graph.epics["epic name"].createChild("child name", 9)

                        WHEN Story Graph Node creates new child with identifical name as another child of Node
                        THEN Story Graph Node identifies duplicate name
                        AND returns error

                        WHEN Story Graph Node creates new child  without a name
                        THEN System populates name with unique field (eg: Child1)
                        Example: child = bot.story_graph.epics["epic name"].createChild()

                        WHEN Epic creates a child SubEpic
                        THEN Epic adds Sub-Epic to children
                        Example: subEpic = bot.story_graph.epics["epic name"].createChild("sub epic name")

                        WHEN SubEpic with no Story children creates a child SubEpic
                        THEN SubEpic adds SubEpic to children
                        Example: subEpic = bot.story_graph.epics["sub epic name"].createChild("sub epic name")

                        WHEN SubEpic creates Sub-Epic that has Stories children
                        THEN SubEpic identifies SubEpic already contains Stories
                        AND returns error indicating cannot create SubEpic under SubEpic with Stories
                        BUT prevents create operation

                        WHEN Sub-Epic with no SubEpic children creates a child Story
                        THEN Sub-Epic creates default StoryGroup under Sub-Epic
                        AND Sub-Epic adds Story to Stroy Group
                        Example: subEpic = bot.story_graph.epics[sub "epic name"].createChild("story")

                        WHEN SubEpic creates a child Story with existing Story children
                        THEN SubEpic adds Story to existing SubEPic's Story Group

                        WHEN SubEpic creates Story that has SubEpic children
                        THEN SubEpic identifies SubEpic already contains Sub-Epics
                        AND returns error indicating cannot create Story under SubEpic with Sub-Epics
                        BUT prevents operation

                        WHEN Story creates Scenario 
                        THEN Story adds Scenario to common scenario child collection
                        BUT Story does not add Scenario to acceptance criteria child collection

                        WHEN Story creates ScenarioOutline 
                        THEN Story adds ScenarioOutline to common scenario child collection
                        BUT Story does not add Scenario to acceptance criteria child collection

                        WHEN Bot creates AcceptanceCriteria under Story
                        THEN Story adds Acceptance Criteria to its own child collection
                        BUT Story does not add  Acceptance Criteria to scenarion child collection

                    (S) Move Story Node To Parent
                        WHEN Story Graph Node moves to new parent
                        THEN node removes itself from current parent
                        AND node adds itself to target parent as last child
                        AND resequences original siblings on or after orignal location
                        Example (parent API): bot.story_graph.epics["target epic"].addChild(childNode)
                        Example (child API): childNode.moveTo(bot.story_graph.epics["target epic"])

                        WHEN Story Graph Node moves to new parent with position specified
                        THEN node removes itself from current parent
                        AND node adds itself to target parent at specified position
                        AND resequences all children at or after position in both locations
                        Example (parent API): bot.story_graph.epics["target epic"].addChild(childNode, 2)
                        Example (child API): childNode.moveTo(bot.story_graph.epics["target epic"], 2)
                       
                        WHEN Story Graph Node moves with invalid position specified
                        THEN adjusts position to last if exceeds children count
                        AND moves node to adjusted position
                        Example (parent API): bot.story_graph.epics["target epic"].addChild(childNode, 99)
                        Example (child API): childNode.moveTo(bot.story_graph.epics["target epic"], 99)

                        WHEN Story Graph Node moves to same parent different position
                        THEN node removes itself from current position
                        AND node adds itself at new position
                        AND resequences siblings
                        Example (child API): childNode.moveTo(currentParent, 3)
                        Example (child API): childNode.positiion =3 //property encapsulate logic

                        WHEN Story Graph Node moves to parent where it already exists
                        THEN Story Graph Node identifies child already under parent
                        AND returns error

                        WHEN SubEpic moves to SubEpic that has Stories
                        THEN target SubEpic identifies it already contains Stories
                        AND returns error indicating cannot move SubEpic to SubEpic with Stories
                        BUT prevents move operation

                        WHEN Story moves to SubEpic that has SubEpic children
                        THEN target SubEpic identifies it already contains Sub-Epics
                        AND returns error indicating cannot move Story to SubEpic with Sub-Epics
                        BUT prevents move operation

                        WHEN Story Graph Node moves to create circular reference
                        THEN node identifies target parent is descendant of itself
                        AND returns error indicating circular reference
                        BUT prevents move operation

                    (S) Delete Story Node
                        WHEN Story Graph Node deletes itself without children
                        THEN node removes itself from parent
                        AND resequences remaining siblings
                        Example: bot.story_graph.epics["epic name"].sub_epics["sub epic name"].delete()

                        WHEN Story Graph Node deletes itself with children
                        THEN node moves all children to node's parent as last children
                        AND removes itself from parent
                        AND resequences siblings
                        Example: bot.story_graph.epics["epic name"].delete()

                        WHEN Story Graph Node deletes itself including children
                        THEN node recursively deletes all children
                        AND removes itself from parent
                        AND resequences siblings
                        Example: bot.story_graph.epics["epic name"].deleteWithChildren()

                    (S) Update Story Node Name
                        WHEN Story Graph Node renames itself
                        THEN node validates name not empty
                        AND validates name unique among siblings
                        AND updates node name
                        Example: bot.story_graph.epics["old name"].rename("new name")

                        WHEN Story Graph Node renames itself with empty or whitespace-only name
                        THEN node identifies name is empty
                        AND returns error

                        WHEN Story Graph Node renames itself with duplicate sibling name
                        THEN node identifies duplicate name among siblings
                        AND returns error

                        WHEN Story Graph Node renames itself with valid special characters
                        THEN node validates name format
                        AND updates node name

                        WHEN Story Graph Node renames itself with invalid special characters
                        THEN node validates name format
                        AND identifies invalid characters
                        AND returns error

                    (S) Execute Action Scoped To Story Node

                        WHEN Story Graph Node executes action with valid parameters
                        THEN node validates action exists
                        AND node invokes bot to execute action with scope context
                        AND node validates graph structure remains valid after execution
                        Example: bot.story_graph.epics["epic name"].executeAction("build", {"output": "docs/stories"})

                        WHEN Story Graph Node executes action with invalid parameters
                        THEN node invokes bot to execute action with scope context
                        AND bot validates action parameters are invalid
                        AND returns error with parameter requirements


                    (S) Persist Story Graph Changes

                        WHEN Story Graph structure is modified
                        THEN Story Graph validates graph structure integrity
                        AND Story Graph persists changes to storage
                        AND Story Graph updates version metadata

                        WHEN Story Graph persists changes successfully
                        THEN Story Graph writes updated graph to file
                        AND Story Graph verifies write successful

                        WHEN Story Graph persistence fails
                        THEN Story Graph identifies write failure
                        AND Story Graph rolls back in-memory changes
                        AND returns error with failure details

                        WHEN Story Graph validates structure after modification
                        THEN Story Graph checks all node references valid
                        AND Story Graph checks sequential order consistency

                        WHEN Story Graph identifies structure violations
                        THEN Story Graph identifies violation details
                        AND Story Graph prevents persistence
                        AND returns error with violation specifics
