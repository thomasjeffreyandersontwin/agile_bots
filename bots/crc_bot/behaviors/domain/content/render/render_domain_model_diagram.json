Generate Mermaid diagrams from the extracted domain_concepts structure showing CRC cards with responsibilities and collaborators. IMPORTANT: Each sub-epic represents a namespace. Domain concepts are grouped by their namespace (sub-epic name). Class names are prefixed with their namespace using the format 'Namespace::ClassName'. If a namespace name conflicts with a class name (same name), the namespace is prefixed with an underscore (e.g., '_Namespace::ClassName'). Concepts at the epic level are assigned to the first sub-epic's namespace (or epic name if no sub-epics exist)."
